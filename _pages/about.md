I am a doctoral student in the Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization (ACO) program at Georgia Tech‚Äôs School of Mathematics. My research interests are in Combinatorics, Probability and Algorithm. I am fortunate to be advised by [Will Perkins](http://willperkins.org/).

Here is my [CV](/files/CV.pdf)

My Favorite Math Quote:
