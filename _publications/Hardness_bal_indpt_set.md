excerpt: 'We give evidence of a statistical-computational gap for finding balanced independent sets in random bipartite graphs of average degree d, where d is a large constant. While balanced independent sets of density (2+o_d(1)) log d/d exist whp in such graphs, ther best known efficient algorithm (which is very simple) can only find balanced independent sets of half this size. We show that neither local algorithms nor low-degree algorithms can do better.'
